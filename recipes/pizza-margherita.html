        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza Margherita is a timeless classic that celebrates simplicity and fresh ingredients. With a thin, crisp crust as the base, it's topped with tangy tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, and fragrant basil leaves. Baked until bubbly and golden, this Neapolitan-style pizza delivers balanced flavor with every bite — fresh, savory, and utterly satisfying.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>1 ball of pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li> 
               <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (San Marzano or crushed tomatoes with a pinch of salt)</li>
               <li>4-6 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into pieces</li>
               <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
               <li>1-2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
               <li>Salt, to taste</li>
               <li>All-purpose flour (for dusting)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven - Heat oven to 475°F (245°C) or as high as it will go. If using a pizza stone, preheat it as well.</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough - On a floured surface, stretch or roll the dough into a 10-12 inch circle. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet or pizza peel.</li>
                <li>Add sauce - Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                <li>Add cheese - Scatter torn mozzarella pieces over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Bake the pizza - Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.</li>
                <li>Finish and serve - Remove from oven, top with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. Slice and serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
