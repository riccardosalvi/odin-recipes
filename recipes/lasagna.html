        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This hearty lasagna recipe is a comforting, flavor-packed dish layered with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and perfectly cooked pasta sheets. The base starts with a savory blend of ground beef and Italian sausage, simmered in a robust tomato sauce seasoned with garlic, onions, basil, and oregano. A generous layer of velvety béchamel or ricotta adds creaminess between the noodles, while a blend of mozzarella, Parmesan, and provolone melts into a bubbly, golden crust on top.</p>
        <p>Each bite offers a satisfying balance of textures and flavors, from the tender pasta to the savory sauce and gooey cheese. Whether you're preparing it for a family dinner, meal prep, or a special gathering, this lasagna holds its structure well and tastes even better the next day. It's a classic comfort food that brings warmth to the table and leaves everyone asking for seconds.</p>
